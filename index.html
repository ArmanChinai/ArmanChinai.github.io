                        Hi, I'm Arman. I currently am located near Vancouver, B.C in Canada, and I am going into 10th grade! I came to Summer Discovery's Computer Programming Academy with little to no experience. Over two weeks, both Ms. Claire and Mr. Clark have taught me crucial information about the fundamentals of coding in HTML5 as well as game development in a program called Unity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Unity, we developed a variety of projects showing us how to animate and control variables in one scene. The highlight of my experience with Unity was developing a game with a car that could drive across a plane. I altered the flight to have mountains and valleys, adding more depth to the scene. In HTML5, we learned how to use various tags to create our own website, and then uploaded it to the web using GitHub. We learned how to code in both HTML5 and CSS to make a related and aesthetic website.

                            In Unity, we learned how to animate various Game Objects and control them using assigned movement keys. We eventually were tasked with designing a game that included a moveable car, as well as a sculpted terrain. To the right is a screenshot from the project showing the model car as well as some ground. The project was challenging at first, as there were complications with installing script for the vehicle that included velocity and advanced movement tech, as we had not learned that yet, as well as downloading a car model from the internet. These challenges were overcome by exploring in the Unity Store to find the right car model and proper script. We were able to create the sculpted terrain by using the various paint brushes within Unity. We used the terrain paint brush to create the mountains and valleys, and the texture paintbrush to create the look of sand and grass.

                            On this frightful day, it has become aparent that Quinn Thompson will not be allowing me to access his prized possession, his website. Despite numerous attempts to infultrait his top secret project, I have come back unsuccessful. I am writing to this journal to commemorate my defeat, as the loss in this great battle will be remembered for generations to come. Hopefully in the future we will be more succsesful in infultraiting quinn's top secret website. Until Then
